# Hangman
This is a Python script of the classic game "Hangman". 
It picks any random word from the wordlist we have created and displays it in a row of dashes. 
If the player guesses a correct letter in the word, the script writes it in its correct position. 
You can easily customize the game by changing variables.
# How to play
Run hangman_solutions.py file to begin playing. 
A mistery word with number of blanks will appear according the the number of letters in the random word which picked.
Keep entering the letter to guess the word, if letter is correctly guessed, blanks will get filled by the letter replacing blanks. 
If the letter is wrong, we lose one of the lives. 
If we guess 5 wrong letters, game ends.
If we guess all the letters correctly without losing all the lives, we win and get a congratulation message.
# Project story
This is my first project and i have tried my best to include few extra features in the game. 
I may consider making few changes in near future.
